            <p>
                My name is Eric Wang and I am a full stack web developer. I know how to program using JavaScript and its related technologies, such as Express, MongoDB, and Node. Over my time in the bootcamp, I have built up quite a few projects in my GitHub repository, which can be found in the footer link that says 'GitHub'. You can also view my resume, contact information, and portfolio (6 projects) by clicking on the header options. I have done a lot of good individual and group projects, and I hope you will like them.
