# Challenge 20: Professional Portfolio with React

## Description
It is important to keep your updated professional materials in one place so that other developers can see the work you have done and potential employers can assess your skills. This project uses React to create a dynamic portfolio that can render sections of content without reloading the page. I learned how to use React components to build the page layout, track user input in real time with `useState()`, and validate form input.

## Installation
Get started by opening the `package.json` file in the Integrated Terminal and running `npm install`. This action will install the packages shown in the `dependencies` section of the following image:

You will also install the dev dependency `gh-pages @6.0.0` (not shown).

## Usage
The deployed application can be found [here](https://gimmekitties711.github.io/challenge_20-eric_wang_react_portfolio/).

My portfolio features the following sections:

**Header:** You can use the navigation options to view different components of the page. The one that you are currently viewing will be highlighted.

**About Me and Footer:** The `About Me` section features my GitHub profile picture and a paragraph about my skill set and the work that I have done. The footer features three links, `GitHub`, `LinkedIn`, and `YouTube`. Clicking these links will take you to my profiles on the corresponding sites.

**Important:** All links open in a new tab.

**Portfolio:** This section features six of the projects that I completed during my time in the boot camp. Each project card contains links to the corresponding GitHub repository and deployed application.

**Contact:** This section features a contact form where you can enter your `Name`, `Email`, and `Message`. All three fields are required, and your email address must be in a valid format, for example `green@gmail.com`. Once all of the input requirements have been met, you can click the `Send` button and I will receive an email containing the information you submitted. **Serious inquiries only, no spamming please.**

**Resume:** This section lists my front-end skills, back-end skills, and general skills. You can download my resume by clicking the `Download my resume` button. The file name will be `Resume-Eric_Wang.pdf`. If you download the file more than once, the file names will be `Resume-Eric_Wang (1).pdf`, `Resume-Eric_Wang (2).pdf`, and so on.
